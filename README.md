The objective of Project 2 is to create a program that will identify objects in a given image. 
The objects that the program can recognize are listed below:
  * Pikachu
  * Drones
  * Cats
  * Dogs
  * People

#The project was done in Google Collab, as anyone in the group can access and modify the code at any time. 
#For the program to recognize the previously mentioned objects, the program had to be trained with images of the listed objects. 
#Roboflow was used to annotate images and find existing datasets to help train our program. Our final dataset contained 6625 images. 
#When the training was done, our program displayed the accuracy values of the objects; the values are listed below:
  * Pikachu:  96.3%
  * Drones:  95%
  * Cats:  91%
  * Dogs:  78.9%
  * People:  92.8%

#Afterwards, the program tested the accuracy by taking various images and outputting the images with a bounding box. 
#In the output image, the class's name and accuracy value are displayed at the top right of the bounding box. 

***Examples*** 
Listed below are the output images of all of the objects from our program
